# 📊 Sales Performance Analytics Dashboard (Excel)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how I transformed raw sales data into actionable insights using **Excel dashboards**.  
The workflow covers **data cleaning → exploratory data analysis (EDA) → pivot tables → pivot charts → interactive dashboards**.

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques
- **Excel**: Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, Timelines, Slicers  
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, formatting, standardization  
- **EDA**: Customer segmentation, product category analysis, revenue trends  
- **Visualization**: Bar, column, and line charts with interactivity  

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Revenue:** $30M total | $60K average purchase | 500 total quantity → high-value, low-frequency sales  
- **Location:** Port Harcourt leads; Lagos ranks third despite being a commercial hub  
- **Customer Segments:** Seniors contribute **62% of revenue**; young adults contribute the least  
- **Products:** Fashion is the most purchased category, but demand is balanced across categories  
- **Customer Dependency:** Top 20% of customers contribute **20% of revenue**  
- **Weekly Trends:** Peaks in Weeks 13, 27, 31, 43, 50 | Dips in Weeks 19, 27, 47, 51, 53  

## 💡 Recommendations
- Engage **young adults** to diversify revenue sources  
- Boost sales in **underperforming locations** like Lagos  
- Promote **high-demand products** while maintaining balanced offerings
